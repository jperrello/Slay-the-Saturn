# MiniStS-Language-Driven-Play-Reimagined
Implementation of Language-Driven Play: Large Language Models as Game-Playing Agents in Slay the Spire by Bahar Bateni and Jim Whitehead. We reuse their MiniStS code, but we add more cards and scenarios. We use LLMs as general game playing agents by understanding cards and playing out the game using that knowledge.
